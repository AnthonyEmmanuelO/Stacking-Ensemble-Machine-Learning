# Stacking Ensemble Machine Learning

The following notebook is a work in progress. 

It aims to be a template for regression tasks by stacking three machine learning models together. 
Using the hyper-optimisation library: Optuna three of the above models are chosen, scaled uniquely and tunned.  These three predictions are then tunned inside the above equation. 

Areas for possible improvement: 
	â€¢ Additional parameters to tune
Classification models
